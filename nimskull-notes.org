#+title: Why nimskull
#+options: broken-links:mark

After another round  of discussions about possible  objectives, reasons and
merits of the Nim fork I've been working  on I decided to write down my own
thoughts on this matter, elaborate  on the decision-making process that has
led to the specific wording of the readme.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclaimer: this  article is going  to have a  lot of disclaimers  down the
road, but  ultimately I admit  the attempt to  write it in  the "objective"
manner failed,  since I have too  much personal investment in  the issue. I
tried to keep the tone in check, but you can never be completely sure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some parts of this article are going to be outdated in the future -- mostly
stuff  concerning PR  aspect of  the  project, how  we advertise  different
elements of it and so on. If  there are going to be any fundamental changes
I will update this text accordingly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To save you  some time, my top  picks when it comes to  spreading FUD about
nimskull are the following, in order of my preference:

1. /"Well good luck hard-forking backwards into the past to re-write commit
   messages."/ ([[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32033473][link]]  and I'm /still/  really puzzled  as to what  the hell
   does that  mean, so if you  want to FUD  in comments *and* use  this one
   *and* can explain it -- I will be really glad to see you)
2. /"Forks  that seem to  exist for no  clear reason other  than disgruntled
   person(s) thumbing their nose at an upstream maintainer never do."/
3. /"So, nimskull is a project management exercise, carry on then"/

* WIP Part one: "why"

Important  disclaimer before  I  go  into long  and  annoying  list of  all
failings that  happened over the  years --  I *personally* think  that this
sort of conduct  is bad and poorly reflects on  the community health. There
might be other points of view, either on specific issues or in general.

Some might consider  a missing Code of Conduct a  major problem, some might
be hell-bent  on a [[https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/9511#62471][multiple]] instances  of a very unwelcome  language, weird
[[https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/9402#61840][rhetoric]] and so on, but I included things that I, *personally*, consider to
be important.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Most common questions concerning "why" aspect  of the project I've seen can
be summarized in the following phrase: "why fork if you can just contribute
to the mainline" or  "why not contribute to the mainline".  There are a few
things in this sentence that need to be unpacked, specifically in the first
variant of it. It  is not always used in this literal form,  but I saw that
formulation often enough to go into the sentence dissection mode.

Let's get  the most  obvious and  irritating response out  of the  way. The
response to *"why do X"* is pretty simple: "because I'm a free person to do
what I want with my free time". So I decided to work on the fork instead of
a main project.

Of course this is just a blanket  "buzz off" response that does not address
the important  questions, but I decided  it is important enough  to warrant
the inclusion.

Second and a lot more controversial response targets the *"just"* word. I'm
sure there are  realms of irritated blog posts, articles  and books written
about "why don't you just do X" and how often it is not all that easy.

Before I go into long detailed list of what is wrong with the mainline, I'm
going  to say  that we  (nimskull contributor  team) explicitly  decided to
*not* to include these sort of historical elaboration in the readme because
it does not  generally help the discussion. Instead of  looking forward and
deciding what do next the discourse  is focused on seeking someone to blame
for various issues.

I've contemplated the idea of writing this  kind of article for a long time
and after about  a year of hearing various questions,  ranging from genuine
confusion (e.g. newcomer  to the mainline gets disoriented  about status of
each projects and  seeks some elaboration) to a commonplace  HN FUD that is
based on the quick skim of the readme.

** Issues with package management

On July 4th, 2021 I wrote  the [[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/398][RFC]] detailing various issues and suggestions
for the package management improvements that provided a detailed account of
most of the things that were wrong with the package manager at the time.

*** UX and implementation issues

*** Non-existent level of interest in package manager improvements

1. Non-existent dependency  resolution algorithm that can  get knocked over
   at any time, causing bugs and repeated installations.
2. Bidirectional data  flow between the compiler and package  manager -- it
   is not  possible to  run the  compiler separately with  the same  set of
   packages as in command-line.


*** Dead community management

By  the  way,   speaking  of  roadmap  and  project   [[https://irclogs.nim-lang.org/03-11-2021.html#11:44:14][management]]  -  nimble
"development has been  outsourced, wasn't ready for 1.6.0 and  I don't know
the plan either"[fn:either-96] -- this happened moths after long discussion
about  added nimble  features, subsequent  reversal  of the  version to  be
release https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8404#54511 and we still don't have any
concrete roadmap about plans to roll out 14.0.

So these are my two cents on how having a good roadmap could've prevented a
almost  a year's  worth  of  effort (pattern  matching)  to  not lose  it's
maintainer, and how you managed to loose a single person who was interested
enough to really  try to compose the plans,  suggestions, improvement ideas
and  vision for  the  package  manager into  something  coherent, not  "the
discussions were  spread through  multiple Github  issues, IRC  and private
chats with the Nim team on Telegram" [[https://discord.com/channels/371759389889003530/753721959308853319/892742985626824734][discord link]].

This is my personal view of the matter, I'm not going to lie and say that I don't care anymore, but I'm certainly burned out by this indifference and uncertainty to the point I no longer want to do anything unless explicitly asked for - and this certainly would not include "please continue to maintain pattern matching"

P.S. you can consider it my resignation letter from the fusion/matching maintainer. I wanted it come to become a standard, but well, not like I can continue to work on it if the fusion itself is dead.

** TODO Issues with the implementation

*** Handling of the community requests

Nim-lang conducts a  yearly community survey with results  available on the
blog. [[https://nim-lang.org/blog/2022/01/14/community-survey-results-2021.html][2021]], [[https://nim-lang.org/blog/2021/01/20/community-survey-results-2020.html][2020]], [[https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/02/18/community-survey-results-2019.html][2019]], [[https://nim-lang.org/blog/2018/10/27/community-survey-results-2018.html][2018]], [[https://nim-lang.org/blog/2017/10/01/community-survey-results-2017.html][2017]], [[https://nim-lang.org/blog/2016/09/03/community-survey-results-2016.html][2016]]. Some questions persisted over the
years.

#+caption: "Top/High", "Medium" and "Low/Ok" priority

As you  can see,  over last  two years number  of respondents  who consider
current  implementation  acceptable  in  terms  of  bugs  decreased  almost
twofold, from  20% to 12%,  while the number  of those who  consider fixing
compiler bugs to be of high  or critical importance increased by 13%. Prior
to 2018 this question was not being asked.

Priority of  the tooling  improvement had  been asked  only twice,  but the
declining trend is present here, although not as drastically.

Documentation quality is steadily improving year-over-year.

Too bad the roadmap still did not include the, well, *road* component of it

**** fusion

I  was  involved  in this  part  personally,  so  I'm  going to  provide  a
first-hand account in this specifically  I worked on the "official" pattern
matching implementation solution.

Back in 2020 ~@alehander92~ (author of  the Gara [[https://github.com/alehander92/gara/][library]], nil [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/15287][check]] feature
and many  [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Aalehander92][other]] PRs) wrote  an [[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/245][RFC]]  about pattern matching.  Several months
later I  [[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/245#issuecomment-695780794][joined]] the discussion,  providing a starting [[https://github.com/haxscramper/hmisc/blob/f58838040170547e19c01bd6b9f3e42a16811f91/tests/tMatching.nim][implementation]]  and a
specification  that later  was [[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/245#issuecomment-697897542][expanded]]  and agreed  upon. At  this time  I
[[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/194#issuecomment-700994731][thought]] it should be a move  to consolidate the ecosystem. I [[https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/pull/33][implemented]] it
for the fusion library  and it was merged after an  initial review.

At this point I thought that people can finally make use of it in different
scenarios, simplify writing macros and so on, writing my [[https://github.com/nim-lang/website/pull/252][first]] iteration of
the article. About  two weeks later fusion was [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/16925][unbundled]]  from the standard
library and  left on it's own  as a separate  package with an idea  it will
also [[https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/issues/30][adopt]] semantic versioning (never really  happened). Then I had to wait
for over a month until by patience finally [[https://github.com/nim-lang/website/pull/252#issuecomment-786700979][ran out]] and I decided to publish
it  myself somehow.  Eventually it  was [[https://github.com/nim-lang/website/pull/271][published]],  received 145  points on
[[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26420716][hackernews]]. In march someone made a video tutorial on the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJpn6SfR_1M][library]].


Then nim 1.6.0 introduced the ~nnkTupleConstr~ - ~fusion/matching~ required
some  fixing, so  ~@clybber~ [[https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/pull/86][fixed]]  it  in, so  far so  good. Except  after
unbundling never  received any  proper tags, and  people still  [[https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/issues/99][get]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/nim/comments/qfi1d0/fusionmatching_broken_in_nim_16/][version]]
that is nine months old. I  wasn't really privy into the management details
and simply worked on the [[https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/pull/94][PR]] with additional fixes.

My PR had  a CI failing for  a five months purely  due to [[https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/pull/100][misconfiguration]],
and I  had to personally  come and complain about  it in order  for leorize
(another person who moved to nimskull btw) to fix it.

After fixing CI -- Half a month forward, zero reaction. Is fusion a part of
the current  nim effort, or is  it not - I  don't know. Each time  it was a
waiting game, or I had to personally come and push people around so someone
even looked at my efforts, maybe even reviewed the code. No, five months of
silence with  dead CI,  no understanding  if my work  is even  needed, then
another half a month with fully green CI, and still no reaction.

Then "Preview of the coming attractions"  [[https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8627][thread]] happened. I made the point
[[https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8627#56155][above]], then got a fantastic exchange that I'm going to simply paste here in
it's entirety,  it is too  good to  slice and dice  into parts. I  will add
footnotes instead.

-------

*Araq*:

I'm really sorry for your bad experience and I hope you'll come back. Fusion is part of what we offer, it's however badly maintained as I get no emails from github when there is activity. I think I enabled the email feature, I'm not sure why I still don't get any. I also don't know why so few people appear to have the proper rights to merge things on Fusion, I'll see what we can do.

    So these are my two cents on how having a good roadmap could've prevented a almost a year's worth of effort (pattern matching) to not lose it's maintainer ...

Sorry, but that's not how I see it, since we are overburdened with work, the proper solution is to give you more rights so that you can go ahead and not be constantly blocked by us.


-------

*haxscramper*:

NO, the  proper solution is not  to give me  "more rights" - have  you even
read what I said about fusion and my PR?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote


The solution is not  to give me more permissions in  hope I will accomplish
something without any supervision. Now I have even more responsibility, and
I  have  double-think  any of  my  decisions  -  are  they right,  do  they
contribute to the final goal (whatever it is). You just made situation even
worse - before I just doubted if my  work is needed, but now I also have to
constantly carry the  burden of even higher-level decision  making and face
decision paralysis with no clear common goal in sight.

#+begin_quote
Fusion is part of what we offer,  it's however badly maintained as I get no
emails from github when there is activity.
#+end_quote

It  is badly  maintained not  because  you don't  get emails,  it is  badly
maintained because  I'm yet to  see a  single finalized decision  about it.
Nobody understands it's status, and people can't really work in dark. After
we decided to unbundle it, it practically became an abadonware. I mean, for
half a year nobody  even looked at the CI - the  fix was absolutely trivial
except you  need to  know that "nim-lang.org  no longer  provides versioned
MinGW", which  I of course  had no idea about,  since I don't  use windows.
Well, I should've probably pinged you right there, right? Except

#+begin_quote
... but that's not how I see it, since we are overburdened with work ...
#+end_quote

And you  know, for  some weird reason  I'm not thrilled  about the  idea of
constantly  pinging  people who  say  stuff  like  this  with (and  have  a
perfectly valid reason to say this,  which is even more important). I mean,
my problem is not that important,  and I might distract them from something
actually important, so maybe  I just need to wait, I'm  sure they have some
kind of planning going on ..., right?

#+begin_quote
give you more rights so that you can go ahead and not be constantly blocked
by us.
#+end_quote

and turn  the language into  complete mess  by my misguided  decisions? No,
thank  you, I  do not  trust  myself enough  to make  decisions that  would
benefit everyone. Or I were supposed  to somehow build a sub-community with
whom I  can discuss  my decisions on  the implementation  details? Maintain
dedicated set  of issues on  pattern matching in  fusions, treat them  as a
sort of "local RFC" and basically  replicate the whole process on a smaller
scale?

-------

*Araq*:

Yes, I did read it, all of it. Yes, I do care about pattern matching and Fusion and I love your work on it.

#+begin_quote
It is badly maintained not because you don't get emails, it is badly maintained because I'm yet to see a single finalized decision about it.
#+end_quote

We don't  bundle Fusion with  Nim anymore  because that causes  yet another
"split" -- you can update it independently  from Nim, so if we also ship it
with Nim both of these modes must be tested and be ensured to keep working.
Ensuring that stuff keeps working can be surprisingly hard. Fusion also had
other design  mistakes, like  an unreasonable backwards  compat requirement
for code that is supposed to evolve.

A "finalized" decision would be easy:  Let's split up Fusion into different
packages,  there  can   be  nim-lang/pattern-matching,  nim-lang/threading,
nim-lang/javascript-wrappers,  nim-lang/xyz. The  problem?  It's really  as
mundane as setting up N Nimble packages plus the CIs plus ensuring that the
CIs stay green and that things work well together.

--------

*haxscramper*:

Making it a multitude of packages instead of one single package addresses none of the concerns I expressed above. It is just shuffling responsibility around, and further separating the efforts.

nim-lang/pattern-matching - It seems like my last idea was close enough

#+begin_quote

my  decisions on  the  implementation details?  Maintain  dedicated set  of

#+end_quote

I can do this, it is possible, but  what is the point even? I get nim-lang/
prefix for  the repo  and some sort  of the "official"  status? I  can just
maintain my own library, we have a PM so people can just require things.

--------

*haxscramper*:

With each  step we are  getting farther and  farther away from  my original
goal - not  in the stdlib because we should  use "upcoming" let expressions
(where  is a  roadmap). Not  in the  fusion because  maintainer's incentive
slowly withered away in complete silence. Now  the solution is to make it a
collection of packages in nim-lang/ organization.

--------

*haxscramper*:

#+begin_quote
I'm really sorry for your bad experience and I hope you'll come back.
#+end_quote

Sorry, but no, I sort of made up  my mind before hitting the "Reply" on the
first comment, since it  was not a trivial decision for  me, I really don't
like to burn the bridges.

Followed discussion just made it clear I no longer want to have anything to
do  with  fusion&related  -  I  will  just  dive  into  abyss  of  complete
uncertainty, I don't need any of that.

I will just  maintain my own library  - kind of sad all  my aspirations and
work effectively amounted to a xkcd comic

-----

*Araq*:

#+end_quote

Good points. But the "official" status is not marketing, it implies that the code got reviewed, that it is our recommended package, that it's covered by a CI, that it keeps working.

------

*haxscramper*:

Almost two weeks  later, fusion is not  tagged (surely it was  hard to do),
released roadmap does  not even mention it, nimble is  briefly described as
"We hope to  be able to ship a  new Nimble with the 2.0 release  but we are
happy to ship  it whenever it's ready." (probably my  RFC is either implied
as "you should  know about it" or something like  that, definition of ready
is not provided, no idea what state is it in now)

So I think that

#+begin_quote
I'm really sorry for your bad experience and I hope you'll come back
#+end_quote

Pretty much amounts to "I will pretend I care, but I really don't, and this is certainly not something worth mentioning on the roadmap"

-------

*Araq*:

#+begin_quote
released roadmap does not even mention it
#+end_quote


Fusion is  not part  of the  plan. You want  me to  make decisions,  I make
decisions, and then I make the wrong ones. It's inevitable.

#+begin_quote
nimble is briefly described as...
#+end_quote

Edit: I extended the section on Nimble a little bit.

------

*haxscramper*:

Main point was - two weeks after fusion is still not tagged and still breaks the code on 1.6, but since it is "not part of the plan" I guess this can be ignored.

-------

*Araq*

I could give you  the rights so that you can fix and  tag things on fusion.
But you didn't want that so instead you have to be patient.

------

*haxscramper*:

Maybe it  makes sense to just  admit fusion has absolutely  no maintainers,
and find someone who is willing to  do the job? Think about enabling people
to do the work  for you instead of singling out me  just because I happened
to raise the  problem. "you have to  be patient" - yes,  and everyone using
1.6.0 and unable to  compile basic example from the manual.  (by the way, I
said  I'm not  willing  to  shoulder the  responsibility  to  make the  API
decision  and  self-approve  them  without any  external  review,  this  is
different from being able to tag things. Latter one takes like five minutes
at  most,  and does  not  have  any  major  implications. Certainly  not  a
backbreaking effort, so if you want, you can give me permissions and I will
make this one-line commit).

-----

*Araq*

We released a  new version of Fusion. The next  time problems arise, please
use Fusion's issue  tracker. If you get no feedback  there, create an issue
on Nim's issue tracker instead.

------

Last [[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/476][discussion]]  about fusion talked  of its  deprecation. [[https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/pull/16][PR]] took  about a
year to be reviewed.

So, to summarize -- in a span of about a month since I got my PR merged the
project  silently moved  from the  "official implementation"  to "we  don't
bundle it anymore" and then continued to rot from there.

  official account  for this and judging  from some [[https://discord.com/channels/371759389889003530/371759607934353448/973912902903951382][remarks]] ("And  then how
  Status pays Araq  money is something for  him to explain if  he wishes, I
  know some  details but don't  want to make it  public in case  he doesn't
  want to.") it is not considered important enough to be discussed.
- Nim has [[https://nim-lang.org/blog/2021/10/25/nim-receives-100k-usd-bitcoin.html][received]] 100k in bitcoin  donations that then were transferred to
  this  [[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1BXfuKM2uvoD6mbx4g5xM3eQhLzkCK77tJ][address]] and  subsequently split  into  [[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qzgw3vsppsa9gu53qyecyu063jfajmjpye3r2h4][these]] [[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qde22ua57hqvl36657mkx4x2gvwp5gn5xh34g6f][two]],  where the  money
  reside up to  this day. I've never  heard about any plans  to do anything
  with these  money, but  the USD value  had dropped by  a factor  of three
  since then.
- It is not really clear who actually works on the project full-time and is
  paid  core contributor,  who  is  just a  volunteer  and  who is  getting
  periodically [[https://opencollective.com/nim/expenses/97898][paid]] to work on a  specific [[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/437#issue-1058638395][tasks]] (most checkpoints had been
  closed by the ~@xflywind~).

* Part two: "nimskull"

There is no point denying that the project had started as a fork of the nim
programming language  compiler, but at  the same time  it is less  and less
relevant as time goes  on, because we want to move into  the direction of a
/better language/ not a /better reimplementation of a nim compiler/.

A  specific meaning  of  this  distinction will  be  provided  in the  next
section, here I will briefly talk  about some of the common misconceptions.
After this  article is  written I  will try  to update  the readme  text to
reflect the list.

* Part three: our deal

This  is  specifically  aimed  to provide  the  explanation  about  working
procedures in  the project,  explain the  value framework  that is  used to
decide what  is going to  be worked  on and what  is going to  be postponed
until a later time.

I  decided it  would be  better  to formulate  my  ideas on  this topic  as
precisely as I can,  even if it will sound harsher than it  needs to be. It
probably won't end up in readme,  because that sort of wording and language
is very unlikely to excite new contributors and users.

On a basic level, each project is working off a finite resource -- there is
a limited number of people, they don't have an infinite amount of time they
can dedicate, they don't  want to have a /burnout on  the OSS/ projects and
they want to /work on the stuff they enjoy/. At this moment in the goals of
the project are almost entirely by contributor team. Said team decided that
it would be the best user of their time to (in no specific order):

1. *DO  NOT* provide a LTS  version that keeps backward  compatibility with
   mainline nim.
2. *DO  NOT* /try/  to keep  the backwards  compatibility in  the following
   cases (and similar scenarios):
   1. If better language design emerges.
   2. If the feature had already been marked as deprecated in the mainline
   3. If the feature is implemented in form of opt-in language dialect
   4. If keeping the feature intact will require significant compromises on
      the code quality and maintainability.
3. *DO  NOT* hesitate  to make  a hard decisions  if it  would allow  for a
   large-scale cleanup to move forward.
4. *DO* work on the internal documentation, development history
5. *DO* work that improves the internal architecture of the compiler.
6. *DO* reduce the barrier of entry to the new contributors
7.  *DO*   prioritize  the  consistent  language   design  over  occasional
   convenience.
8. *DO*  work on consolidating  existing language dialects into  a /single/
   language, not exponential number of possible flag combinations.
9.  *DO* work  on specifying  exact  rules of  the aforementioned  /single/
   language.

Having read that a user can  decide for themselves whether *they think* the
trade-offs are acceptable  *for them*.

Personally, I  think it is important  to honestly set the  expectations and
adhere  to the  community  contract  you proposed,  rather  than trying  to
accommodate for every  single user from the old community.  Yes, that might
sound overly harsh, but  I don't want to move along  the =vlang= route with
over-promises and under-deliveries.

Three important  points that should  be emphasized  in regards as  to where
this list is relevant and where it is not:

1. The  list above explains the  principles under which we  operate when it
   comes to the decisions related  to the *implementation* and weighing out
   the  pros  and  cons  of  technical  decision.  Discussion  process  and
   community handling  are regulated  by the  Code of  Conduct and  Code of
   Ethics which take priority over all interactions.
2. The list should serve as a  breakdown of the developer team priority and
   served as  a first filter  that is used  to consider specific  ideas and
   requests.
3. It explicitly does not provide breakdown of a specific new feature-based
   objectives  in this  section. Current  part of  the work  is focused  on
   solving implementation issues with already existing features.

* Part four: our vision

In this  section I will  briefly outline a  general vision for  the project
moving forward. After more than a year of work it is a good idea to draw on
the newly discovered knowledge to help better define the direction.

This section does  not focus on the specific technical  details -- they are
provided in section five, "our scopes".

* Part five: our scopes

In this section  I will provide a more technical  explanation about current
stage of the development, how it correlates with a vision from the previous
section ("our vision") and issues in the implementation "why".

This section  is mostly in line  with the near-term development  [[https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull#near-term-development][roadmap]] in
the  readme,  but  provides  a  lot more  historical  elaborations  on  the
implementation details.  I try  to keep  the most  relevant details  of the
reimplementation progress updated in the [[https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull/discussions/142?sort=new][thread]].

* Part six: my vision

#+begin_center
Why *I* decided to contribute to this specific project.
#+end_center

I've already provided  most of the historical context I  could get my hands
on, so in this  part I'm instead going to focus on  the my personal account
of working for nimskull.

* Part six: my scopes

As a  contributor to the project  I have some  ideas of my own  that either
haven't been  in the discussion  for a long time  or too fuzzy  to properly
place on the roadmap. I will  discuss them in the following section, adding
to the master plan from the part five.

In  most cases  they  have  already been  discussed  /somewhat/ in  various
places, but are currently too far from the present state of things.

** Documentation generation

*** Problem

Specific features of the documentation generator have always been a notable
pain point for me  with respect to the ~nim doc~  command. Some people have
already ([[https://gradha.github.io/articles/2015/08/sad-ways-documentation-generation-tools-suck.html][Sad ways documentation generation tools suck - Rants from the
Ballmer Peak]]) voiced ([[https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/447][Split documentation generation for easier tooling
and better jsondoc · Issue #447]]) their ideas and concerns. Missing pieces
include

- Ability to sort generated documentation in any way -- entries are grouped
  based on the macro/iterator/proc/func/template/method/type basis and then
  sorted alphabetically.
- Incredibly  verbose  system of  the  internal  references that  makes  it
  largely unusable for any sort of complex linking.

  In order to link the type somewhere you  need to spell out a full name of
  the  procedure with  all of  its argument  types. Now  imagine trying  to
  casually write documentation for some internal compiler module and having
  to link /this/:

  #+caption: pickBestCandidate is a semcall.nim function
  #+begin_src nim
proc pickBestCandidate(c: PContext,
                       headSymbol: PNode,
                       n: PNode,
                       initialBinding: PNode,
                       filter: TSymKinds,
                       best, alt: var TCandidate,
                       errors: var seq[SemCallMismatch],
                       flags: TExprFlags) =
  #+end_src

  Note -- the whole  codebase has a single procedure with  this name, so it
  is entirely possible to just resolve it from the name alone.

- It  is not  possible  to  get structured  output  from the  documentation
  generator. Produced 'structured' json  internally contains formatted HTML
  pieces instead of a structured information.

- Documentation generation happens in a single run, with ~runnableExamples~
  handled in a non-parallel way. Syntactic  errors in a single comment fail
  the whole  project build and so  do runnable examples. Running  either of
  the  source  code  pieces   below  with  src_sh{nim  doc  --errormax=1290
  file.nim} will  cause compilation  to fail  on a  first invalid  piece of
  code.

  #+caption: Syntax error in the documentation
  #+begin_src nim
proc bad*() =
  ## *??

proc thing*() =
  ## *?
  #+end_src
- Implementation of the documentation generator is pre

*** Solution

Just as most of the other core tools documentation generator lacks any form
of  intermediate  representation  that  can  be used  to  easily  create  a
structured  output.  Things  are  often  [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/daf35c6d1b4bc1377bf278aa265dab30c9f5867e/compiler/docgen.nim#L1204][formatted]]  in-place  or  converted
[[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/daf35c6d1b4bc1377bf278aa265dab30c9f5867e/compiler/docgen.nim#L1117][directly]] from ~PNode~ [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/daf35c6d1b4bc1377bf278aa265dab30c9f5867e/compiler/docgen.nim#L1108][to]] json, HTML or LaTeX with [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/daf35c6d1b4bc1377bf278aa265dab30c9f5867e/compiler/docgen.nim#L379][two]] [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/daf35c6d1b4bc1377bf278aa265dab30c9f5867e/compiler/docgen.nim#L477][hardcoded]] [[https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/daf35c6d1b4bc1377bf278aa265dab30c9f5867e/compiler/docgen.nim#L515][outputs]].

Lack  of IR  is an  obvious  issue that  prevents  any sort  of the  output
customization.  A  better  solution  would be  to  have  some  intermediate
machine-readable format  that can then  be converted into  a human-readable
output.  Because  documentation generator  effectively  needs  to create  a
database of the whole project the  most obvious solution would be to create
an sqlite database from the code.

*** Extra features that solution would enable

- Because public API can now be  stored in a fixed-format database it might
  be  possible to  determine the  differences between  two versions  of the
  public API.

** Package management solution

*** Problem

Putting aside many different implementation, UX and ideological issues with
nimble that I already outlined in  the previous section, the most important
one is the philosophy it tries to impose on the user. Fundamentally it says
that there should be only one command  nim user should use and it should be
~nimble~. Install packages,  compile the code, run the code,  test the code
and so on. There is a lot of  information that you can't get out of nimble,
even in the ~.nimble~ script.

- If you  have a  custom ~test~  target and want  to get  the full  list of
  packages in the same way as a native ~test~ does -- it is not possible.
- If you want to run an extra  tool, such as ~testament~ for your tests and
  pass the list of the packages nimble  knows about -- you can't, this data
  is not exposed.

There  are many  counterpoints  to the  minimum  version selection  package
managers, most of  which talk about how things are  "usually" done and that
it "does not  make sense" or "nobody would manually  upgrade the packages".
Most of them effectively  boil down to the fact that =MVS=  is not the best
tool for every single workflow, which is perfectly understandable.

There  are  also   several  considerations,  both  of   the  technical  and
ideological  nature  that  are  involved  in  decision  about  how  package
management is done.

- First  and foremost  -- /proper/  implementation of  the maximum  version
  selection  is  a  complicated  task  because  the  problem  itself  is  a
  NP-complete. There have been [[https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/issues/890][discussions]] about.
