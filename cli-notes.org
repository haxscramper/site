* Modern replacement for the old CLI tools

- grep -> ack, rg
- find -> fd
- sed -> sd

* Debugging and tracing tools

** =strace=

- Thread/process-related
  - ~-f~ follow threads created by a process
  - ~-p <PID>~ attach =strace= to a running process with specified ID.
- Trace-related
  - ~-e  <trace>~ or  ~-e  trace=<trace1>,<trace2>~ to  trace  one or  more
    different traces.
  - ~-o <file>~ - save trace to an output file
  - ~-t~ include timestamps in the traces
  - Grep  trace output  ~strace  <args...> 2>&1  | grep  <args  ...>~ -  by
    default, =strace= outputs the trace into the stderr, not stdout.

* Networking tools

** =iw= and =iwctl=

*** =iwctl= shell

Commands  can be  inputted either  in  the running  =iwctl= shell  or in  a
regular shell (as src_sh{iwctl <command>}).

- src_sh{known-networks list}
- src_sh{station <station> scan} - scan for all networks that can be accessed
  using station (interface).
- src_sh{station list} - show all existing stations
- src_sh{station <station> connect <network>}. The first placeholder comes
  from the ~station list~ and the second one is from ~station scan~




** =ip=

- ~ip link set dev <device> down~

* Music controls - =mpd=, =cmus=

** =mpd=

- src_sh{mpc next} :: switch to the next song
- src_sh{mpc prev} :: go to the previous song
- src_sh{mpc toggle} :: pause or stop the current song

** =cmus=

- src_sh{cmus-remote --next} :: go to the next song
- src_sh{cmus-remote --prev} :: go to the previous song
- src_sh{cmus-remote --play} :: pause or stop the current song

* Package management

** Arch linux
