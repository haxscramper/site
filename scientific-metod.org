Mostly quotes and  notes on the definitions of certain  words and breakdown
why specific pairs of words should not  be confused with each other. It is,
of  course, incomplete  and does  not encompass  the whole  breadth of  the
possible interpretations of the definitions provided here -- I'm only using
it to clean up some things for myself.

- theory ::

  #+begin_quote
A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world and
universe that  has been  repeatedly tested  and corroborated  in accordance
with  the  scientific  method,  using accepted  protocols  of  observation,
measurement, and evaluation of results.
  #+end_quote

  Theory can incorporate laws, facts, inferences and tested hypotheses.

  Difference from
  - fact :: Theory is used to explain facts
  - law :: Does not try to  explain *why* certain things are happening this
    way. Only explains *what* is happening,  and to certain extent *what is
    going to* happen.


- law :: A descriptive generalization about  how some aspect of the natural
  world behaves under stated circumstances.

  First  few paragraphs  in  the  Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law][article]]  give  a good  relative
  overview of the definition and it's difference from other terms.

  - theory  :: Theories  are usually  broader  in scope  and might  include
    several laws.
  - hypothesis :: Were not tested to  the same degree, but they might *lead
    to* (not turn into!) a law
  - fact ::


- hypothesis :: A proposed explanation of the phenomenon.
- fact :: An  observation that has been  repeated so many times,  it can be
  considered "true" for all intents and purposes.
  - theory :: Used to explain facts
  - hypothesis ::
- model ::

  #+begin_quote
Generally, models are schematic representations of reality or of one's view
of a possible  world, constructed to improve one's  understanding about the
world and/or to make predictions.
  #+end_quote
  - fact, theory :: Model can be seen as an intermediate step between facts
    (data) and theories.
